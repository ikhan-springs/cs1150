# CS 1150

This repository contains my Java programming assignments for the course CS 1150: Principles of Computer Science.

CS 1150 gives an introduction to programming with an emphasis on computer science concepts. The objectives of this course were learning to develop methods for computer problem solving, learning to develop proficiency for programming in a modern programming language (Java), and being introduced to the concepts of abstraction in problem solving. The course also included basic concepts of computer systems and environments, including debuggers, editors, and file systems.
